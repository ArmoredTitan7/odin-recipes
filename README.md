<p><strong>homework :)</strong></p>
<p>Well learning all of that at 33 and without english being my mother language. I believe it's never too late :)</p>
<p><strong>Thank to Odin project.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So the objective of this is to create basically a website for FOOD using html / css / js from scratch up.</strong></p>

<p>At the present time 22/9/23 i currently know only very basic html coding so will follow just the simple assignement and maybe add additional simple stuff not learnt in the courses to spice it up and test</p>

<p>My First objectives / assignement for this food site. created on the 22/9/23</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Will want to create basically a home page that has a small introducction of what the website has to offer</li>
    <li>This will include links to particulary 4-5 things ( Savory page ( that will incxlu 4-6 dishes), Sweet ( 4 dishes), Drinks (6 drinks), How to + glossary , Ingredient)</li>
    <li>It will be a straighforward ingredient followed withj instructioin .without the blabla of many other websites.</li>
    <li>It will include the reference from where it was brought or where the idea came</li>
    <li>It will include a pairing to one of the drinks hyperlinked</li>
    <li>Also some of the ingredients could have link to other website on how to create them if they want to be substitued from store bought</li>
    <li>And a suggested dessert to accompany it hyperlinked</li>
    <li>Each type fo dishes/cocktail prensentend might have some links to a definition or how to. plus the ingredient definition of the stuff that are harder to find. ( this will be based on brussels as a location )</li>
  </ul>
</p>
      
    
   <p> I am excepted to have a total of 4+1 folder in the repository ( as per some of the courses ) </p>
   <p>
     <ul>
       <li>CSS ( that won't be usin) </li>
       <li>Pages</li>
       <li>Images</li>
       <li>Java ( that won't be usin)</li>
       <li>1 Video ( that won't be usin)</li>
       </ul>
    </p>   
     
   <p><strong>Pages should contain a total of about 18 pages</strong></p>
      <p>Images first estimation about 12 </p>
      
<p>I believe my biggest challenge might be overthinkin it and overdoing it + the git commit and what is called atomic :)</p>
